Note: I did the code before being awared of the particular requirements for this lab, thus you can see
2 AimsProject files: the standard one is the one adhere to this lab requirements, while the full one is 
me hard coding the entire requirements from the Aims problem, thus it is bound to have errors and not being 
particularly "clean" due to my still limited knowledge of Java. The full one is almost done, besides the 
use case for the store manager. I'd like to finish it so maybe in case you see a commit behind the deadline
then it's not me turning in late but just that i want to finish the whole thing. Thank you for reading.
