Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
A: No, Java wouldn't allow to do that because both constructor would have 
the same signature (public DigitalVideoDisc, String...), thus the compiler
cant distinguish between them. In order for that to be possible then they'd
have to be of different signature so Java can tell which is which.
