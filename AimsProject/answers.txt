Q: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
A: By definition, Java is a pass by value language - When you pass an argument to a method, Java copies the value of that argument into the methodâ€™s parameter. 
However, the confusion usually comes from when passing an object argument to a method, as variables that refer to objects store the value in memory that the objects
also point to. So changing an attribute in the local object would also change its value in the global object that was referred to (thus make people usually confuse 
with pass by reference).
